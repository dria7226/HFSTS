COMMON INTERPRETER

- implement binary tree traversal? (maybe just a couple variables)
 Recalculate when:
  - resizing the program memory
  - resizing program array
  - inserting arrays
  - setup
 Save current node and recalculate it when:
  - tree is recalculated
  - a head switch happens
  - moving to a different node
  
 - convert 1d coordinate to 2d

- convert code to fit new capacity array

- make unified way of doing failsafes and transfers

- add windows default array

- make the constant a third transfer type
     0-1 - write to , 00-10 - read from
 :(((
- reading/writing files (stdio.h)

- create and finish core programs
 - GO_TO_ARRAY?
 - INSERT_ARRAY
 - read time
 - logical or, and, not, shift, xor
 - create window
 - create texture
 - compile shader
 - read keyboard
 - read mouse

 - read joystick

 - read taps
 - read gyroscope

- work on helpers.c
- work on test_program
- test all code
  - test head functions
  - test memory functions
